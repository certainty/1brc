# 1BRC(L)

One billion row challenge attempted to be solved in common lisp. 
The details for the challenge are here: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc


## Why?

I was just curious how far I come with this. At this point I don't even know if I can solve it in acceptable time.
We will see.

## How to run 

set the filename in `main.lisp`

  ``` shell
$ make
$ DATA_FILE=/path/to/file ./bin/1brc 
  ```
  
You can tweak the behavior by setting the `WORKER_COUNT` and `CHUNK_SIZE` variables.
